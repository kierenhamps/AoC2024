# Advent of Code 2024

My first attempt at Advent of Code!

## Goals

The crafted code should be:

- Go idiomatic
- Readable and concise
- Using DDD to encapsulate data and logic into the domain
- Test Driven

## Running

To run the various challenges first `cd` into the required day and simply run `go run main.go`

## Testing

To run tests you can either run `go test ./...` from the root directory, or `cd` into the required day and run `go test .`
